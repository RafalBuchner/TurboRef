### TODO/info
- look at trufont glyphview objects, the main area shouldnt be maybe scene, better zoom could be implemented for the widgets
- interestingScripts/image_zooming_with_billinear_interpolation.py - example of using Pillow (PIL) module for bilinear interpolation: good for zooming in and out and having good looking images
